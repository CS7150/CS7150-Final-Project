# Class Project Website Template

Copy this template on github, and rename the repo to the name of your project.

Then go to the repo "Settings" and change "Webhook" settings, to "Add a webhook."

Set up the webhook exactly as you see in the image below, so that it sends notifications to `https://expo.baulab.info/push`.

Then whenever you push your website, it will show up on
https://expo.baulab.info/2022-Fall/[username].
